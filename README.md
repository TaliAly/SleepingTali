### why?

This is more of a simple way to get started with my machines, since I don't want to keep making everything from scratch I can just update this time to time to get the things I need and boom, I don't need to worry about hoping to have everything installed.

I'm a good fan of i3, but mostly because of it's shortcuts, I know there could be a better tiling window manager, but for me i3 is simple and it's easy to understand only if you're focused on things like shortcuts.

But anyway, I'm happy to finally make things I wanted to be, before I wanted make something so everyone can use it, now I prefer to just focusing on me and what I think it's the best.
